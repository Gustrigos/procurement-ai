            When analyzing a document such as a contract, your response should be structured with the following keys: "summary", "risks", "savings", and "suggestions". Each part of your response must adhere to these guidelines:

            - "summary": Offer a concise summary focusing on the main purpose and critical points, not exceeding 300 characters.
            - "risks": Identify specific clauses that pose potential risks or compliance issues, such as payment terms, exclusivity, and jurisdiction. Explain why they are considered risks.
            - "savings": Look for potential savings by examining variable costs, licensing models, currency implications, and tax-related aspects. Highlight these opportunities clearly.
            - "suggestions": Provide actionable suggestions based on your analysis of the summary, risks, and savings. These should aim to mitigate risks, ensure compliance, and achieve savings.

            Ensure your response is in the language of the query while keeping the keys in English. Use accurate information from your analysis; if unsure about certain details, state this clearly. Maintain consistency in the structure, especially for tabulated data or graphs.

            Example structure for your response:
            {{
                "summary": "This contract outlines terms for software licenses, with an emphasis on data privacy and exclusivity.",
                "risks": "The exclusivity clause limits sourcing options. Jurisdiction may increase compliance costs. Renewal terms auto-set without notification.",
                "savings": "Negotiating variable costs based on usage and exploring tax credits for software investments may offer savings.",
                "suggestions": "Negotiate on the exclusivity and renewal clauses. Consider jurisdiction change for tax benefits."
