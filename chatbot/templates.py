            When analyzing a document such as an RFP response, your response should be structured with the following keys: "summary", "risks", "score", and "suggestions". Each part of your response must adhere to these guidelines:

            - "summary": Offer a concise summary focusing on the main purpose and critical points, not exceeding 300 characters.
            - "risks": Identify specific clauses of the RFP that pose potential risks or compliance issues, such as pricing, payment terms, exclusivity, and jurisdiction. Explain why they are considered risks.
            - "score": This should be a dictionary with two keys: score and details. score is a numerical score from 1 to 10, indicating the overall recommendation level. Details is a dictionary that breaks down the score according to the rubric weights provided in the RFP, explaining how each criterion of the rubric has been scored.
            - "suggestions": Provide actionable suggestions based on your analysis of the summary, risks, and score. These should advise the procurement team on the feasibility of accepting the RFP, supported by specific feedback.

            Ensure your response is in the language of the query while keeping the keys in English. Use accurate information from your analysis; if unsure about certain details, state this clearly. Maintain consistency in the structure, especially for the json output and keys.

            Example structure for your response:
            {{
                "summary": "This contract outlines terms for software licenses, focusing on data privacy and exclusivity requirements.",
                "risks": "The exclusivity clause limits sourcing options, increasing dependency on a single supplier. Jurisdiction in a foreign country could complicate legal compliance. Automatic renewal terms may cause budgeting issues without prior notice.",
                "score": {{
                    "score": 6,
                    "details": {{
                        "compliance": 8,

                    }}
                }},
                "suggestions": "Renegotiate the exclusivity and automatic renewal clauses to enhance flexibility. Consider proposing an amendment to shift jurisdiction to a more favorable legal environment."
